Not even two hours of planning, studying bus route maps, timetables, map of Kyoto and planning online routes helped us to find the right bus stop this morning. We did however find two bus shelters with the same name but not with the bus number route we were seeking. With a little help from a local we hopped on another bus and then connected to bus 59 to get to our final destination.  

It was well worth it, the Kinkakuji Temple (Golden Pavillon) was breathtaking! It was truly one of those jaw dropping wow moments.

The golden Phoenix on top of the temple faces west as a sign of good fortune.

This statue was made to ward off white snakes which are believed to have a negative impact on water supply. As a result of having this statue in the pond there had not ever been a water problem here. 

This stone seat was designed for noble folk and only noblemen were allowed to sit here. Today anyone is allowed to sit here, so feeling rather noble we did.

The tree in this building takes 30 years to grow its trunk to the thickness of a finger.  This tree has grown here for 600 years.

We then visited Ryoanji Temple which is well known for its rock garden.this garden was created at the end of the Muromachi period, around 1500, by a Zen monk, Tokuho Zenketsu.  The garden measures 25 metres from east to west and ten metres from south to north. It is not your usual garden, there are no trees, it is a Zen garden with only fifteen rocks and white gravel.the walls are made of clay boiled in oil, we could see where the oil has seeped out.

In the Gyoen National gardens surrounding the Kyoto Imperial Palace we found a children's park. "Yippee" shouted Jennifer and James. The very next second they were sliding down the slippery slide.

Jason and Kathy reminisced about their childhood as this is the type of playground we remember when we were growing up.

These gardens are open to the public, whilst the Kyoto Imperial Palace requires a permit for entry.The Palace and gardens are about 63 hectares and located right in the centre of Kyoto.

Kyoto was the capital of Japan for over 1000 years. In 784 Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Heijokyo (present day Nara) to Nagaokakyo in Kyoto.He moved the capital again in 794 to Heiankyo in the centre of present day Kyoto city.Today the capital is obviously Tokyo as in 1869 the Emperor chose to move and it has remained there since.

The Kyoto Imperial Palace was burnt on a number of occasions. We remembered that after the palace burned down again in 1854, the Tokugawa Shogunate ordered that an Imperial Palace identical to its predecessor be immediately built.He made it a competition and I t was completed with exceptional speed. It is the Palace that remains today.

We entered the Kyoto Imperial Palace through the Seishomon gate.We were taken to the Okurmayose which was the entrance used for official visits.

Takamichondi -  Emporer's seat

Shunkoden - made of Japanese cypress when Emporer was enthroned. Two Emporers were enthroned at Kyoto Imperial Palace.

The roof of the Palace is still made of Japanese cypress today. The oil based properties of the cypress still provide a waterproof function. It has become expensive and is now reserved for use on Palace and Temple roofs only. It takes 25 years to restore the roof and it needs replacing every 30 years.  To replace the roof 75 layers of paper thin cypress are placed in a shingle type fashion and every 12 sheets are held together with hundreds of handmade bamboo pegs.

Unlike the Golden Pavillion, the Silver Pavillion didn't have any trace of silver. It was built in 1407 as a retirement home for the Shogun and apparently there were plans for it to be coated in silver leaf but he ran out of money. It has now been converted into a Zen temple with a mirror like pond and beautifully manicured gardens. The sand is raked and the hillside is mossy. We enjoyed the walk to the top of the hill to see the view of Kyoto.

Hand out packs of tissues on the streets.


We discovered that meiji vanilla ice cream is oishii, very creamy and smooth.
