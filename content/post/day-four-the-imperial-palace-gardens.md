It was an early start for the Lollback's and we were off to the Imperial Palace Gardens. When we arrived at the kikko-mon gate we went on a guided tour of the West gardens. We listened to an English recording and admired the amazing scenery and plants in the Imperial Palace Gardens.

After the tour we ate morning tea in the East gardens. Then we walked to Tokyo Station to book tickets for traveling to: Hakuba, Osaka, Hiroshima, Kyoto and back to Tokyo. Whilst we were there we activated our Japan Rail Passes. 

We left the ticket booth and went shopping in Tokyo. James, Dad and I went to the Apple Store and Mum looked in department stores. the department store that Mum looked in had a staircase up the side of the building, so James, Dad and I HAD to walk up them. It was a nice view -except - it was blocked by the concrete wall that acted as a railing.

At the top of the building we decided to take the elevator down to meet Mum. Then it was dinner - time we searched for a restaurant. We settled on an Italian style restaurant called Saizeriya. We ordered: 1 pizza, 2 pastas, some roast potatoes, carbonara with spinach    and chestnut sauce with ice cream and chocolate cake for dessert. Then we caught the train home and went to bed.
