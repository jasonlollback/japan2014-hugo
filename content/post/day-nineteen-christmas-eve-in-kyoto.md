Now we were settled in Kyoto, we needed a Christmas tree, so James and Jennifer assembled and decorated our traveling tree. We unpacked our origami Santas and hooray, we were ready for Christmas.

We have an apartment in the best location, just around the corner from Teramachi-dori street and the Nishiki Food Market. Woo Hoo!!! So we just had to explore....

There was seafood galore, alive and fillets. Fresh fruits and vegetables in abundance.  Lots of pickles. Delicacies of all imaginable and unimaginable kinds.  Kathy tried pickled radish, which was unusual but ok.  We bought some vegetables including purple skinned potato which we'd seen done tempura style in Tokyo but we wondered what it would be liked mashed.  We loved the handicrafts and there were many and they were beautiful.  We were like children in a candy store.

We found these Christmas dress ups and had to try them out, it was Christmas Eve after all!
