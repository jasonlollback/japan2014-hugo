Today we decided to visit the Hiroshima Children's Museum.  The first activity we spied was a ball maze. We had great fun winding balls onto the run at different locations and watching them complete the track.

Jen enjoyed making electricity by picking up a ball with a control panel and dropping it through a basketball hoop.

Mr White would be proud of Jennifer and James making circuits with bulbs and batteries.

It was time for a sprint so we tested how fast can the Lollback's could run:

Racing the cars with solar power was awesome! You had to maintain the solar light on your race car for it to have enough solar power to move.

It even had solar panels on helicopters whose rotors spun when given solar energy and animals that moved.

The model train track with Shinkansen and trams was a lot of fun. The A700 Shinkansen was fitted with a camera so you could watch the view from the driver's seat.  We enjoyed driving the various modes of transport around the rails.

We launched a rocket into space and attempted to land at our assigned mission location. Some attempts were successful, others were not.

After lunch we boarded the Street Car tram and headed to the Hiroshima Port. It was rather cold and windy but we we saw some big boats and would you believe they had markets here!!

A little shopping on the way home kept us entertained especially since there was a market fair day and we were able to taste test some yoghurt, cheese, milk, donut, cream bun and juice. James thought it was especially great.

We ordered a smorgasbord of dishes for dinner to try some new dishes.
