Another magical morning in Hakuba as we awoke to find the incredible snowfall this village experiences.  Apparently it can snow these beautiful fluffy flakes for two weeks straight.

We marvelled at the variety of snow machines that came out this morning.  We saw enormous machines designed to clear the roads, small motorised ones to clear a path around houses and one that the driver sits in and drives about.

We just had to go out and play! We were just continually amazed at how light and fluffy a huge handful of snow was. Equally it was amazing and impressive when it went splat on someone, like a huge powder puff!  Needless to say snowballs were flying everywhere.  

More snow angel fun was to be had.

We found a huge mound to slide down so couldn't waste that opportunity.

We found that some children had made snowmen in front of the Hakuba Ski Condo where we were staying, so we joined in the fun. Three more snowmen were added to the village:

Princess Snowmania created by Jennifer:

After hours of snow fun, it was time for hot chocolates all round.  We reminisced about the fun we've had in Hakuba and know we will have wonderful lifetime memories.

We seem to stumble across lots of interesting things, we found this interesting creation in the garden. We have seen a few variations from the train in home gardens and thought it was a clever way to reuse, recycle and reimagine.
