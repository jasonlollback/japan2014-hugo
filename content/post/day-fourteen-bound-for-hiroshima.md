We made our way on the Osaka Loop line and Rapid Train to Shin-Osaka, you see James can't get enough train rides! At Shin-Osaka we we caught the Shinkansen Sakura 553 to Hiroshima. It was rather luxurious and a most enjoyable train ride.

We arrived at the Rhinga Royal hotel in Hiroshima and was excited to find we had a room on the 24th floor with a view of the Hiroshima Castle.

We decided to hop on the loop bus to do a tour of Hiroshima.  We caught our first glimpse of the Peace Museum, saw many street cars (trams), in fact James counted around 30 and a different view of the Hiroshima Castle.
