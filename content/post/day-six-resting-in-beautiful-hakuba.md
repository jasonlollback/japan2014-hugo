We could literally just admire the view here all day! It is exceptional and rivals anything we have ever seen before. A heavy snowfall overnight has left the carpet of snow as a sight to behold.

It is raining today and the apartment manager Bob said a couple of degrees lower and it will snow.

The rain stopped after lunch so we ventured out to play in the snow. James and Jennifer are both very good snow ball shots and the resulting giggle is very infectious.

It was fun running through the snow but the streets were slippery where it was icy, so we had to be careful in a few places where we crossed.
